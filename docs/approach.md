### **Introduction**
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an automated method to design deep learning models, eliminating the need for manual architecture tuning. In this project, we leverage NAS to optimize architectures for tasks like image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. NAS has become an essential tool in deep learning due to its ability to outperform human-designed architectures while reducing the time required to find optimal configurations.

Our approach draws inspiration from the comprehensive survey paper **_"Neural Architecture Search: Insights from 1000 Papers"_** by Colin White, Mahmoud Safari, et al., which outlines the key components, challenges, and methodologies in NAS. We will explore two popular NAS techniques: **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)**.

### **Dataset Overview**
We will use the **CIFAR-10** dataset for this project. These datasets are commonly used benchmarks for NAS studies. They consist of image data (CIFAR-10: 32x32 images across 10 classes), which are ideal for testing architectures in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

### **Neural Architecture Search Techniques**
According to the paper _"Neural Architecture Search: Insights from 1000 Papers"_, there are several popular methods for NAS. We will focus on two:

1. **Reinforcement Learning-Based NAS**  
   A controller (typically an RNN or LSTM) proposes an architecture. The architecture is trained and evaluated, and the feedback (accuracy, computational cost) is used as the reward signal for the RL agent. This process iterates until an optimal architecture is found.

2. **Evolutionary Algorithm-Based NAS**  
   Evolutionary algorithms use principles of biological evolution, such as mutation, crossover, and selection. A population of architectures is evolved over time, with better-performing architectures selected and mutated to create new candidate models.

### **Steps in the Approach**

#### **1. Search Space Definition**
A key insight from White et al.'s paper is the importance of carefully defining the **search space**. The search space consists of different candidate architectures the NAS will explore. We will:
- Define basic building blocks (e.g., convolution layers, residual connections).
- Establish the range of hyperparameters (e.g., number of filters, kernel size, depth) the algorithms will explore.

**Update:**  
- The search space for this project will dynamically generate architectures consisting of convolutional layers with varying numbers of output channels, kernel sizes, and strides. The first layer is fixed to accept 3 input channels (for RGB images), and global average pooling is applied before the final fully connected layer.

#### **2. Reinforcement Learning for NAS**
- **Controller Design**: An LSTM-based controller will generate neural network architectures sequentially (layer-by-layer). The controller’s actions (e.g., selecting the number of filters, kernel size) define the architecture.
- **Reward Function**: The reward is based on the model's accuracy on a validation set, penalized by the model's computational cost (FLOPs or inference time).
- **Training Process**: After each proposed architecture is trained and evaluated, the RL agent updates its policy based on the reward signal.

**Update:**  
- The controller generates architectures in the form of `(out_channels, kernel_size, stride)` tuples. To ensure valid architectures, we apply constraints, such as ensuring that `out_channels` is never less than 1 and `kernel_size` falls within a reasonable range (e.g., 3, 5, 7).
- A **BasicBlock** class defines the convolutional layers, and a fully connected layer is applied after global average pooling to handle the CIFAR-10 classification.

#### **3. Evolutionary Algorithms for NAS**
- **Initialization**: Begin with a population of randomly generated architectures.
- **Mutation and Crossover**: Each architecture undergoes mutations (e.g., changes in the number of filters or the type of activation function), and crossover between top-performing architectures introduces diversity.
- **Selection**: The top-performing architectures are selected based on validation accuracy, and the process repeats for a fixed number of generations or until convergence.

**Update:**  
- The EA approach mutates the number of filters, kernel sizes, and strides for each convolutional layer while ensuring that each generated architecture is valid.
- The population evolves over several generations, with selection based on validation accuracy and architecture complexity.

#### **4. Evaluation and Model Training**
The final architectures discovered by both RL and EA approaches will be trained on the full dataset, and their performance will be compared in terms of:
- **Accuracy**: Test set accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.
- **Computational Cost**: The number of parameters, FLOPs, and inference time.

**Update:**  
- The evaluation function uses global average pooling to reduce feature map size before passing it to the fully connected layer. This ensures that the model can handle varying architecture configurations efficiently.
- Complexity is penalized based on the number of parameters in the model to balance accuracy and efficiency.

#### **5. Performance Metrics**
- **Accuracy**: How well the model performs on the test set.
- **Complexity**: Computational complexity metrics such as the number of parameters and inference time.
- **Search Efficiency**: The number of architectures evaluated before reaching optimal performance.

### **Challenges**
- **Computational Resources**: NAS is computationally expensive due to the number of architectures that must be evaluated. We will mitigate this by using smaller datasets and leveraging efficient NAS techniques, such as weight-sharing or using pre-trained layers.
- **Overfitting**: Since NAS evaluates a large number of architectures, there is a risk of overfitting to the validation set. Techniques like early stopping and cross-validation will be employed.

### **Key Insights from 'Neural Architecture Search: Insights from 1000 Papers'**
According to White et al.'s paper, several best practices can guide NAS projects:
1. **Search Space Design**: A well-designed search space is critical to NAS performance.
2. **Weight-Sharing**: Leveraging techniques like weight-sharing to avoid training every candidate architecture from scratch significantly reduces the time needed for NAS.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Balancing accuracy with computational costs is essential, as some architectures may be highly accurate but impractically slow or resource-intensive.

---

### **Extensions**
- **Multi-Objective NAS**: Incorporate multi-objective optimization where architectures are optimized for both accuracy and efficiency simultaneously.
- **Transfer Learning with NAS**: Use NAS to find architectures that generalize well across multiple datasets or tasks, incorporating transfer learning techniques to adapt architectures discovered on CIFAR-10 to other tasks.

### **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the power of Neural Architecture Search in automating the design of deep learning models. By exploring both reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithm approaches, this project highlights how NAS can be used to find architectures that balance accuracy with computational cost, as discussed in the paper *"Neural Architecture Search: Insights from 1000 Papers"*. This project not only emphasizes advanced machine learning techniques but also showcases practical insights for building efficient and powerful neural networks.
